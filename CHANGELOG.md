All notable changes to the AITrader project will be documented in this file.

## [2025-03-06] - Implementation of Real-Time Trading Components

**Files Created:**
- AITrader.Core/Services/RealTimeTrading/RealTimeTradingService.cs
- AITrader.Core/Python/RealTime/realtime_analyzer.py
- AITrader.Core/Python/RealTime/socket_client.py
- AITrader.UI/Views/RealTimaTrading/RealTimeTradingView.xaml
- AITrader.UI/Views/RealTimaTrading/RealTimeTradingView.xaml.cs

*Implemented a comprehensive real-time trading system integrating with NinjaTrader 8. This implementation includes a C# service (RealTimeTradingService) that manages the interface between the application and trading platforms, a Python-based real-time market analyzer that utilizes the hierarchical agent architecture for live trading decisions, and a socket client for bi-directional communication with NinjaTrader. The UI now includes a dedicated real-time trading interface with live market data visualization, trade execution controls, and performance metrics monitoring. This new functionality enables the AITrader system to transition from backtesting to live trading environments while leveraging the same hierarchical agent architecture.*

## [2025-03-05] - Implementation of Pending Modules

**Files Created:**
- AITrader.Core/Python/Agents/hierarchical_evaluation.py
- AITrader.Core/Python/Agents/data_preparation.py
- AITrader.Core/Python/Agents/callback_handlers.py

*Implemented the remaining core components of the hierarchical agent architecture. The hierarchical_evaluation.py module provides comprehensive tools for evaluating the complete agent system, including performance metrics for each agent layer and a backtesting engine. The data_preparation.py module handles preprocessing and feature engineering tailored to each agent type, with specialized features for different market regimes. The callback_handlers.py module implements training monitors and handles checkpoint management, early stopping, and visualization of training progress.*

## [2025-03-05] - Initial Changelog Creation

**Files Modified:**

*Initial creation of the changelog file to track all future code changes in the AITrader project.*

## [2025-03-05] - Implementation of Hierarchical Agent Architecture

**Files Created:**
- AITrader.Core/Python/Agents/no_trade_filter_agent.py
- AITrader.Core/Python/Agents/meta_agent_selector.py
- AITrader.Core/Python/Agents/base_agent.py
- AITrader.Core/Python/Agents/bullish_agent.py
- AITrader.Core/Python/Agents/bearish_agent.py
- AITrader.Core/Python/Agents/range_agent.py

*Implemented the core components of the hierarchical agent architecture for the AITrader system. This implementation includes the No-Trade Filter Agent (top-level decision maker), Meta-Agent Selector (market regime classifier), and specialized trading agents (Bullish, Bearish, and Range) optimized for different market conditions. The architecture follows a hierarchical decision-making process where the No-Trade Filter first determines if market conditions are suitable for trading, then the Meta-Agent Selector identifies the market regime, and finally the appropriate specialized agent executes trading strategies optimized for that specific regime.*
