*Implemented the core components of the hierarchical agent architecture for the AITrader system. This implementation includes the No-Trade Filter Agent (top-level decision maker), Meta-Agent Selector (market regime classifier), and specialized trading agents (Bullish, Bearish, and Range) optimized for different market conditions. The architecture follows a hierarchical decision-making process where the No-Trade Filter first determines if market conditions are suitable for trading, then the Meta-Agent Selector identifies the market regime, and finally the appropriate specialized agent executes trading strategies optimized for that specific regime.*
