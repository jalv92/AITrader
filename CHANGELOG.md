# Changelog

All notable changes to the AITrader project will be documented in this file.

## [2025-03-05] - Implementation of Pending Modules

**Files Created:**
- AITrader.Core/Python/Agents/hierarchical_evaluation.py
- AITrader.Core/Python/Agents/data_preparation.py
- AITrader.Core/Python/Agents/callback_handlers.py

*Implemented the remaining core components of the hierarchical agent architecture. The hierarchical_evaluation.py module provides comprehensive tools for evaluating the complete agent system, including performance metrics for each agent layer and a backtesting engine. The data_preparation.py module handles preprocessing and feature engineering tailored to each agent type, with specialized features for different market regimes. The callback_handlers.py module implements training monitors and handles checkpoint management, early stopping, and visualization of training progress.*

## [2025-03-05] - Implementation of Hierarchical Agent Architecture

**Files Created:**
- AITrader.Core/Python/Agents/no_trade_filter_agent.py
- AITrader.Core/Python/Agents/meta_agent_selector.py
- AITrader.Core/Python/Agents/base_agent.py
- AITrader.Core/Python/Agents/bullish_agent.py
- AITrader.Core/Python/Agents/bearish_agent.py
- AITrader.Core/Python/Agents/range_agent.py

*Implemented the core components of the hierarchical agent architecture for the AITrader system. This implementation includes the No-Trade Filter Agent (top-level decision maker), Meta-Agent Selector (market regime classifier), and specialized trading agents (Bullish, Bearish, and Range) optimized for different market conditions. The architecture follows a hierarchical decision-making process where the No-Trade Filter first determines if market conditions are suitable for trading, then the Meta-Agent Selector identifies the market regime, and finally the appropriate specialized agent executes trading strategies optimized for that specific regime.*
